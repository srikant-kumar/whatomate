Whatomate provides a flexible role-based access control (RBAC) system that allows you to define custom roles with granular permissions.

## Overview

The permission system is built around:

- **Permissions**: Fine-grained access controls for specific actions on resources (e.g., `users:create`, `contacts:read`)
- **Roles**: Collections of permissions that can be assigned to users
- **System Roles**: Pre-defined roles (Admin, Manager, Agent) that cannot be deleted

## System Roles

Three system roles are created automatically for each organization:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Full access to all features including user and role management |
| **Manager** | Full access except user/role management and organization settings |
| **Agent** | Limited access - can only view/respond to assigned chats |

<Aside type="note">
  System roles cannot be deleted, but their permissions can be viewed (read-only).
</Aside>

## Custom Roles

Create custom roles to match your organization's needs. For example:

- **Support Lead**: Can manage contacts and view analytics, but not manage users
- **Campaign Manager**: Can create/manage campaigns and templates only
- **Read-Only Auditor**: Can view all data but not make changes

### Creating a Custom Role

1. Go to **Settings → Roles**
2. Click **Add Role**
3. Enter a name and description
4. Select permissions from the permission matrix
5. Click **Create**

## Permissions

Permissions follow the format `resource:action`. Available actions are:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `read` | View the resource |
| `create` | Create new items |
| `update` | Modify existing items |
| `delete` | Remove items |

### Available Resources

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `users` | User management |
| `roles` | Role management |
| `teams` | Team management |
| `contacts` | Contact management |
| `messages` | Message sending/viewing |
| `templates` | Message template management |
| `campaigns` | Campaign management |
| `flows` | Chatbot flow management |
| `chatbot` | Chatbot settings |
| `webhooks` | Webhook configuration |
| `api_keys` | API key management |
| `accounts` | WhatsApp account settings |
| `settings` | Organization settings |
| `analytics` | Analytics and reporting |

### Permission Matrix

When creating or editing a role, you'll see a permission matrix organized by resource:

```
Users
  ☑ Read users
  ☑ Create users
  ☐ Update users
  ☐ Delete users

Contacts
  ☑ Read contacts
  ☑ Create contacts
  ☑ Update contacts
  ☐ Delete contacts
```

## Assigning Roles to Users

1. Go to **Settings → Users**
2. Click on a user or create a new one
3. Select a role from the dropdown
4. Save changes

<Aside type="tip">
  Changes to permissions take effect immediately. Users will see updated menu items and access controls without needing to log out.
</Aside>

## Super Admin

Super admins have special privileges:

- Access to all organizations (for multi-tenant setups)
- Can switch between organizations using the organization switcher
- Organization switching uses the `X-Organization-ID` header for API requests

<Aside type="caution">
  The `X-Organization-ID` header is only respected for super admin users. Regular users cannot use this header to access other organizations.
</Aside>

### Organization Switching

Super admins see an organization switcher in the sidebar. When switching organizations:

1. All data views refresh to show the selected organization's data
2. API requests include the `X-Organization-ID` header
3. The selected organization persists across page navigation

## UI Behavior

The frontend dynamically adapts based on user permissions:

### Sidebar Menu

Menu items are shown/hidden based on permissions:

- **Chat** - Requires `messages:read`
- **Contacts** - Requires `contacts:read`
- **Campaigns** - Requires `campaigns:read`
- **Templates** - Requires `templates:read`
- **Chatbot** - Requires `chatbot:read`
- **Analytics** - Requires `analytics:read`
- **Settings** - Requires any settings-related permission

### Page Access

If a user tries to access a page they don't have permission for, they are redirected to the first accessible page.

### Action Buttons

Create, edit, and delete buttons are shown only if the user has the corresponding permission. For example, the "Add User" button only appears if the user has `users:create` permission.

## API Authorization

All API endpoints check permissions before processing requests:

```bash
# Returns 403 if user lacks users:read permission
GET /api/users

# Returns 403 if user lacks campaigns:create permission
POST /api/campaigns
```

### Response for Unauthorized Access

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Permission denied: users:create"
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Assign only the permissions users need
2. **Use Custom Roles**: Create roles that match job functions rather than assigning system roles
3. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review role assignments and permissions
4. **Document Roles**: Use meaningful names and descriptions for custom roles
